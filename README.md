This is assigned homework for **Advanced Databases Classes**.

The main aim was to import big data from .xml file and perform some operations on database.

Data source: dbpl.uni-trier.de/xml/dblp.xml.gz (1.9 GB)
Also needed .dtd file (from the same source)


Steps to proceed:

1. Create database with create_database.sql

2. Download .xml and .dtd file

3. Change data.yaml file and fill it with your correct data

4. Install requirements from requirements.txt fle

5. Run import_xml.py


Added mini version of .xml and .dtd file (from given source) just to test for small data.
